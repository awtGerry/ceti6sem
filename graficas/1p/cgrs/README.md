## How to run an algorithm
Every algorithm has his own key, here is a list of them:

- Key: D -> Runs DDA algorithm (R,L)
- Key: I -> Runs DDA algorithm (L,R)
- Key: R -> Runs a Rectangle using DDA
- Key: B -> Runs Bresenham's algorithm
- Key: C -> Runs Basic Circle algorithm
- Key: M -> Runs Mid Point Circle algorithm
- Key: P -> Runs Polar Circle algorithm
- Key: E -> Runs Ellipse algorithm
